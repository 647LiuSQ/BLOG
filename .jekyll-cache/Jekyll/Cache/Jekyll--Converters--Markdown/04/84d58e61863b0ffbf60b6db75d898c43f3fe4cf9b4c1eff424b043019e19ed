I"¸<p>I have studied the theoretical implications of self-paced learning explanations in the past. More specifically, I have studied the optimization perspective of self-paced learning format and the understanding of self-paced learning probability perspective in the past. My team members and I developed a solid understanding of "what self-paced learning is optimizing?" and "how self-paced learning models learn the data distribution".</p>
